## 🚀 About The Project

This project solves the classic dilemma of having a pantry full of ingredients but no inspiration for what to cook. This web application provides a simple and intuitive interface to input the ingredients you own and discover a variety of recipes you can make right now.

The app fetches data from a public recipe API to provide a rich and diverse selection of meals.
